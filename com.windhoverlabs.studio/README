You have successfully created a Yamcs project!

Here are some commands to get things started:

mvn versions:use-latest-releases

    Update all dependencies (incl. Yamcs) to the latest release.

mvn yamcs:run

    Compiles this project and starts Yamcs on localhost.

mvn yamcs:debug

    Same as yamcs:run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 7896.

mvn yamcs:bundle

    Generates a Yamcs distribution for your project.

mvn clean

    Delete all generated outputs and start over.

    This will also delete Yamcs data. Change the dataDir property in yamcs.yaml
    to another location on your file system if you don't want that.
