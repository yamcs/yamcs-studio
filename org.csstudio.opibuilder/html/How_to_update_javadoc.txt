The 'script' subdirectory contains Javadoc for the org.csstudio.opibuilder.scriptUtil package
to document its API for use in scripts.

To update the javadoc after changes to the Java code,
right-click on package org.csstudio.opibuilder.scriptUtil,
select 'Export', 'Java', 'javadoc'.

In dialog, verify that only this subtree of the overall CS-Studio sources is selected.
Set 'Destination' to for example /tmp/script_doc.
Un-check 'Generate navigator bar'.

Select 'No' when asked to
   "..update the Javadoc location for 'org.csstudio.opibuilder'..."
because we don't plan to use the exported doc inside the IDE.

After the export, replace files under org.csstudio.opibuilder/html/script
with the generated files.

The Javadoc format tends to change with JDK updates, so even if only one method in one
scriptUtil class was modified, the complete Javadoc can be different.
You might thus decide to only update the *.html file of the modified *.java code.
